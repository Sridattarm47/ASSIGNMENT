  &quot;One of the world’s most famous contemporary artworks is artist Andy Warhol‘s Campbell’s Soup Cans. Symbolic of the Pop Art movement, the piece illustrates consumerist culture and mass media in American society. In addition to this, Warhol’s signature style is visible in his work. Through the repetition of the represented object, the artist reflects his critique of a consumerist society and its endless cycle of production and consumption.&quot;<br>

Various versions of the piece exist, created using a diverse range of materials. Built for an exhibition at the Tate Modern, it pays homage to Bourgeois‘ mother, who died suddenly when the artist was just 21.&quot;<br>

  &quot;Created at the peak of Jackson Pollock’s career, Autumn Rhythm is a perfect example of the drip-painting technique. The technique, which is specific to Pollock, made him famous due to its originality. To create his works, Pollock stood on his canvas and dripped diluted paint onto the canvas, letting it fall naturally. He would drip, splash, scrape and pour paint onto his canvas. For the artist, the movement and paints themselves drove his art. This unique method of painting is considered to be the artist’s trademark.&quot;<br>
